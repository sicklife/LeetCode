## Search Insert Position


Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Here are few examples.
```
[1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
```
Test the program:
```
python search_insert_position.py 4
```
In this case, 4 is the target and the sorted list is generated randomly.
