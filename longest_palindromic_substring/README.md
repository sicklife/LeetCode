## Longest Palindromic Substring

Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.


A palindrome is a string which reads the same in both directions. For example, “aba” is a palindome, “abc” is not.

Run the program:
  ```bash
python longest_palindromic_substring abcbabb
  ```
