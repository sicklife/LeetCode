##Substring with Concatenation of All Words

You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.
```
For example, given:
S: "barfoothefoobarman"
L: ["foo", "bar"]
```

You should return the indices: [0,9].
(order does not matter).
